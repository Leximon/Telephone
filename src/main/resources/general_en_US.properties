  Start a call from one discord server to another using the {0} command. \
  After starting a call you can talk with others across a discord server while not being in the same voice channel. \
  This bot also uses sound effects to make it even more realistic.\n\
  It's also possible to use the {1} command to start a call with a random discord server that is on the [yellow pages]({8}).\n\n\
  The language of this bot depends on the servers primary language. If the discord server is not a community server the bot will use English as default language.\n\n\
  **__Commands:__**\n\
  `{2}` - Starts a call with a discord server using the phone number (Server-ID)\n\
